            You are going to play a mini-game that predicts whether or not women
            participants will match their male partners in a speed dating event.
            During the event, women attendees had a four-minute "first date"
            with every other man participant. At the end of their four minutes,
            participants were asked if they would like to see their date again.
            Data on 1,000 dates were collected, half of which, or 500 dates,
            resulted in matches, but the other half, 500 dates, failed to match.
            All participants were also asked to rate their date on six
            attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition,
            and Shared Interests.

            ou will be asked to guess whether or not a couple
            will want to date each other again given the demographics of
            participants and their ratings of each other. To be more specific,{" "}
            <strong>
              you will predict the probability of success (i.e., probability
              that a couple will want to date each other) for{" "}

              In step 2, you will be provided with predictions of an A.I. system
              for the same cases you reviewed in step 1. In this step, you can
              decide whether or not to modify the predictions made in step 1. If
              you do not want to modify your previous forecast, please submit
              the same results as in step 1.

          <p>
            At the end of the experiment, you will get points based on the
            accuracy of your final prediction i.e., after you have received the
            AI recommendation. Note that the biggest portion of your pay is
            dependent on your performance (i.e., accuracy) in this task.
